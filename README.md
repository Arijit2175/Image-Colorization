# 🎨 Image Colorization Tool using OpenCV & Deep Learning

Transform old black-and-white photos into vibrant, realistic color images using **Deep Learning + OpenCV**, wrapped in a modern **Tkinter GUI** with advanced post-processing enhancements.
This project leverages a pretrained CNN-based colorization model and applies multiple post-processing techniques to significantly improve visual quality.
