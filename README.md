# 🎨 Image Colorization Tool using OpenCV & Deep Learning

Transform old black-and-white photos into vibrant, realistic color images using **Deep Learning + OpenCV**, wrapped in a modern **Tkinter GUI** with advanced post-processing enhancements.
This project leverages a pretrained CNN-based colorization model and applies multiple post-processing techniques to significantly improve visual quality.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Input image is converted from **BGR → LAB color space**
2. **L channel (grayscale)** is fed to a pretrained CNN
3. Model predicts **A & B color channels**
4. LAB image is reconstructed and converted back to BGR
5. Post-processing improves realism and perceptual quality
